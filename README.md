# Cooking School Website 
---
### The page I made was modeled after a figma file and I did my best to replicate it. Here is the link to the figma file :  [https://www.figma.com/proto/8WKAikBTMgFVXPRWQpYT7i/Sweet-Berries-Cooking-School---Updated?node-id=3384-231] if you want to start working on this website before looking at how I implemented it!

### Learning outcome : 
###  I did face some challenges in the beginning while trying to incorporate grid and flexbox for the first time. The main issue I had was with the layout of the page with grid. Since it was my first time laying out the structure of the page with grid I should of made sure to layout everything before adding all the images and text. After I got over that road block the rest of the styling of the page was easy. The next thing I had issues with was the icons and that had to be in absolute positioning. I realized my error after a couple of hours and it was a really easy fix. This page turned out really well other than those two issues and I'm happy to have learned so much from my mistakes. The only way to get better is to keep on practicing so no matter what I'll always figure it out in the end. If your having trouble take a break and remember to keep approaching it from a different perspective!
